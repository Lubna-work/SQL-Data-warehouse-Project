1-Bronze Layer: This foundational layer retains the original raw data directly from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files and stored in a SQL Server database without any alterations.

2-Silver Layer: In this intermediary layer, data undergoes cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to ensure it is well-prepared for subsequent analysis.

3-Gold Layer: This top layer contains business-ready data that is structured into a star schema, making it ideal for efficient reporting and analytics.

üìñ Project Overview
